# SwiftAudioQueueRecorder
A Swift AudioQueue Recorder based off of Apple's AudioQueue Programming Guide

This is partially based off of IBM's Watson Swift-SDK however it is to be used as a recorder to disk instead of to stream to a server.
Hope this helps people as I was hard pressed to find something like this online.
